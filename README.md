# My Homepage

A collection of tutorials, links and other useful stuff - at least for myself.


## Prerequisites

I'm using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) together with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and the [Chirpy Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy).
The starter template can be found here [Chripy Starter](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter).


## Run Local Server

To run this website locally ensure you have followed the installation instructions in the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). And of course you need [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

Start the Jekyll Server using:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

Use `jekyll help serve` for further options like port.
